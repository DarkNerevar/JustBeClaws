                        We are JustBeClaws, an organization dedicated to keeping kitties off the streets and out of bars. Our mission is centered around our core belief of using spay and neuter coupled with TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) to reduce the homeless cat population and help stop the cycle of suffering. With our incredible team of dedicated fosters located in Topeka, KS and surrounding areas, we provide loving temporary homes for hundreds of cats and kittens each year.  All our furry felines are fixed, vaccinated, and treated for all parasites before they are ready for adoption.

                        Beyond basic medical care, many of our fosters come to us in critical states of starvation, injury, and illness. Our organization has specifically chosen to focus on pregnant/nursing mothers, neonatal kittens, and high needs medical kittens under 6 months of age. There is a gap in rescue care for special needs, neonatal, and young kittens. With a disproportionate amount being euthanized in shelters across the country.

                        That is why we have opened our doors and our hearts to the tiniest lives and those most in need, the ones many have turned away, discarded, and just plain given up on, beClaws we can, and you can help! When you adopt a kitten from JustBeClaws, you will not only gain a friend for life, but you will also be saving the life of a kitten who would have otherwise not have had one.
